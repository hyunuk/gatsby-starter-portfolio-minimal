I am a 3rd year Computer Science student of the University of British Columbia.

My background is a game development. I worked as a Game Designer for about 12 years in South Korea and launched several mobile and online games.

I changed my career to Software Development after I immigrated to Canada as I am fascinated in making software on my own.
